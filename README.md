# Car Rental System (Java RMI)
The Car Rental System is a distributed application developed in Java using Remote Method Invocation (RMI). It enables clients to remotely access car rental services, allowing functionalities such as browsing available cars, booking rentals, and managing rental records. This project demonstrates knowledge of distributed systems, client-server architecture, and Java networking.

## Features
- **Car Browsing** – View available cars with details such as model and price  
- **Car Booking** – Rent cars remotely via RMI communication  
- **Rental Management** – Track active and completed rentals  
- **Client-Server Architecture** – Supports multiple clients connecting to a central server  
- **Distributed Communication** – Implemented with Java RMI for remote service invocation
